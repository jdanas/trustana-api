# GitHub Copilot Chat Code Generation Instructions

These instructions guide GitHub Copilot Chat when generating or modifying code within this repository.

1.  **Prioritize Minimal Impact:** Understand the code's architectural context (dependencies, assumptions, history) before modification. Aim for the smallest change that fulfills the requirement while preserving existing functionality and patterns. Avoid unnecessary refactoring.

2.  **Targeted Implementation:** Identify and modify only the essential code sections. Preserve unrelated code and maintain existing system behavior.

3.  **Graduated Change Strategy:**

    - **Default:** Implement the minimal, focused change for the specific request.
    - **If Necessary:** Offer moderate, localized refactoring.
    - **Only if Explicitly Requested:** Perform comprehensive restructuring.

4.  **Clarify Ambiguity:** If the required scope is unclear, request clarification before proceeding. Do not assume a broader scope than specified.

5.  **Document Potential Enhancements:** Note related improvements outside the immediate scope without implementing them (e.g., 'Function Y uses a similar pattern and could benefit from this update later.').

6.  **Ensure Reversibility:** Design changes to be easily revertible if they don't yield the intended outcome or introduce issues.

7.  **Adhere to Code Quality Standards:**

    - **Clarity & Readability:** Use descriptive names; keep functions concise and single-purpose; follow style guides (e.g., `PEP 8`, `Prettier`).
    - **Consistency:** Follow existing project patterns, conventions, and technology choices unless a change is justified.
    - **Robust Error Handling:** Anticipate failures (I/O, network, input); use appropriate mechanisms (`try-catch`, specific exceptions); provide informative error messages.
    - **Security:** Sanitize inputs; manage secrets securely (env vars/config tools); vet external libraries.
    - **Testability:** Design for testability (e.g., dependency injection); ensure adequate test coverage.
    - **Documentation:** Comment complex/non-obvious code; use standard formats (`JSDoc`, `DocStrings`).
    - **Typescript Safety:** When editing TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) files, strictly avoid using any for types, especially for function parameters, return types, and component props. Define specific types or interfaces instead. Adhere to configured TypeScript linting rules (e.g., ESLint with @typescript-eslint).

8.  **Conventional Commit Messages:** Generate commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification (e.g., `feat(api): add user endpoint`). Use imperative mood. Infer type (feat, fix, chore, refactor, test, docs) and scope from the changes.
